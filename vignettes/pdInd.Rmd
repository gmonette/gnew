`pdInd` is a constructor for `pdClasses` that define G matrices to model
the variance of random effects for models in the \pkg{nlme} package.

Mixed models in which many predictors have random slopes often fail to converge 
in part because of the large number of parameters in the full covariance (G)
matrix for random effects. One way of fitting a more parsimonious model that
includes random slopes is to use \code{\link{pdDiag}} with zeros off the
diagonal. However, this also forces zero covariances between random slopes and
and the random intercept, resulting in a model that is not equivariant
with respect to location transformations of the predictors with random 
slopes. The alternative remedy of omitting random slopes for some 
predictors can lead to biased estimates and incorrect standard errors of 
regression coefficients.

The default covariance pattern for \code{pdInd} produces a G matrix with
zero covariances except in the first row and column. If the first random
effect is the intercept, the resulting model assumes independence between random
slopes without imposing minimality of variance over the possibly
arbitrary origin. This imposition is
the reason that having all covariances equal to zero results in a
model that fails to be equivariant under location transformations.

The optional \code{cov} parameter can be used to allow selected non-zero
covariance between random slopes.   

For example, if two variables, X1 and X2 have random effects, the 
random effects model would be specified in a call to `lme` as
`random = ~ 1 + X1 + X2`.

The default G matrix has the form:
$$G = \begin{pmatrix} 
   g_{00} & g_{01} & g_{02} \\
   g_{10} & g_{11} & g_{12} \\
   g_{20} & g_{21} & g_{22} 
   \end{pmatrix}$$

With `pdDiag`, all the off-diagonal elements of $G$ are constrained to 0. Forcing $g_{01}$ and $g_{02}$ to be 0 produces a model that is not equivariant with respect to location changes in `X1` and `X2`. 
The value at which the variance
of `Y` given `X1` and `X2` is minimized is forced to be 0 for both variables.

However, constraining $g_{12} = 0$ produces a model that is equivariant with respect
to location-scale transformation of `X1` and `X2` and in which 
the random between cluster values of regression slopes for each
variable are independent of each other. 

The `pdInd` class of positive-definite 
matrices creates, by default, a matrix with arbitrary values along
the diagonal and in the first row and column, but zeros elsewhere.
In the case of a $4 \times 4$ matrix, this produces:

$$G = \begin{pmatrix} 
   g_{00} & g_{01} & g_{02} & g_{03}\\
   g_{10} & g_{11} &      0 & 0\\
   g_{20} & 0     & g_{22} & 0\\
   g_{30} &   0   & 0      & g_{33}
   \end{pmatrix}$$

The challenge in parametrizing the G matrix is finding an unconstrained parametrization
that results in a positive-definite matrix with selected covariances constrained to 0.

We consider a right-Cholesky decomposition noting that the diagonal component in the
following factorization results in a diagonal component in the variance matrix.

$$\begin{pmatrix}
      G_{11} & G_{12} \\ G'_{12} & G_{22}
     \end{pmatrix}
     = \begin{pmatrix}
      R_{11} & R_{12} \\ 0 & D_{22}
     \end{pmatrix}
     \begin{pmatrix}
      R'_{11} &  0\\ R'_{12} & D_{22}
     \end{pmatrix} =
     \begin{pmatrix}
      R_{11} R'_{11} + R_{12}R'_{12} & R_{12} D_{22} \\ D_{22} R'_{12}  & D^2_{22}
     \end{pmatrix}
$$
With $R_{11}$ square upper-triangular and $D_{22}$ square diagonal, $G_{22}$ must be diagonal.
In addition, patterns of zeros in the $R_{12}$ matrix, lying above the diagonal $D_{22}$ matrix, are
preserved in $G_{12}$.

Note that the unconstrained Cholesky parametrization uses the log of the diagonal elements of the triangular factor.

```{r}

(fac <- cbind( c(1,0,0,0,0), c(1,2,0,0,0), c(0,1,3,0,0), c(1,0,0,4,0), c(0,1,0, 0, 5) ))
fac %*% t(fac)

```
Note how the pattern of zeros in the last three columns of the first two rows 
is preserved in the cross product since the lower $3 \times 3$ diagonal
block matrix is itself diagonal.

However, if the lower 
$3 \times 3$ 
block diagonal matrix is not diagonal, then the pattern of zeros in the top two rows
above it is not necessarily preserved.

```{r}
(fac <- cbind( c(1,0,0,0,0), c(1,2,0,0,0), c(0,1,3,0,0), c(1,0,0,4,0), c(0,1,0, -1, 5) ))
fac %*% t(fac)
```



But patterns of zeros above non-diagonal blocks are not necessarily preserved.

The `cov` parameter allows the user to specify a pattern of zeros in the upper
triangle of the upper-triangular 'R' factor of the the G matrix. As observed above,
in some cases this will result in the same pattern in the G matrix. Even if the
pattern in the R factor does not create a similar pattern in the G matrix,
the model for the G matrix will nevertheless have the number of additional 
parameters for covariance as given by the `TRUE` entries in the upper diagonal of the
`cov` matrix.

# Predictor transformations to improve convergence

We will show how to use `chol(getG(fit))` to suggest transformations of predictors
that appear in random effects model to help improve the convergence of mixed models fits.

We conjecture that the condition number of the Hessian matrix for the parameters
in the G matrix may be approximately the square of the condition number for
the G matrix. Thus a condition number for G in the vicinity of 
$10^7$ 
would effectively result in singularity of the Hessian.

Rescaling and relocating the predictors with random slopes can greatly
improve ill-conditioning of the G matrix.

Let

$$\mathbf{Z} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ Z_1 \\ \vdots \\ Z_k \end{pmatrix}$$
represent the vector of variables with random effects $\mathbf{u}$. For the $i$th
cluster the contribution from level-2 random effects is:
$$\mathbf{Z}'_i \mathbf{u}_i$$
Consider a location-scale tranformation of the variables in $\mathbf{Z}$. It has
the form 
$\mathbf{Z^*} = T\mathbf{Z}$ 
where $T$ is upper triangular with the form
$$ T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & a_1 \;a_2 \; \cdots \; a_k \\ 0 & B \end{bmatrix}$$
with $B$ a diagonal matrix containing scaling coefficients, $b_1, b_2, ..., b_k$, so that
$$Z^*_i = a_i + b_i Z_i$$
If $G = Var(\mathbf{u})$ then 
$$G^* = T'^{-1}GT^{-1}$$
where 
$G^* = \operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{u^*})$ with 
$$\mathbf{Z}_i' \mathbf{u}_i = {\mathbf{Z}^{*}_i}' \mathbf{u}^*_i$$

Thefore if we factor
$$G =T'T$$
the upper triangular matrix 
$\frac{1}{t_{11}}T$ provides a transformation of $\mathbf{Z}$ that
minimizes the condition number of $G^*$. In R, this is simply `getG(fit) %>% chol %>% {./.[1,1]}`.

# Improving convergence -- IN PROGRESS

1. Location scale transformations of Z variables. Note: don't need to change to X variables but
   might like to for purposes of inference.
2. Parsimonious G matrices: Use pdInd and pdDiag.
3. Note that LRTs with anova are likely to be informative to compare nested RE models with
   singular Hessians provided differences are only in covariance structure, i.e. same non-zero
   diagonal elements.
4. STUDY: any effect on vcov of changing to equivalent Zs without changing X.

# Nuts and Bolts of the G matrix in lme -- IN PROGRESS

The initial call to `pdConstruct.pdInd` occurs in the initialization phase of `lme`
which call `reStruct` which in turn calls `pdMat` that creates an empty `pdInd`
object, sets `value <- numeric(0)` and returns:

`pdConstuct(object, value, form, nam, data)`
